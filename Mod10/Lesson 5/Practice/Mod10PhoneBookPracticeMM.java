2.	What does the variable phoneBook look like after this statement?
	PhoneEntry[] phoneBook = new PhoneEntry[5];
	
	An array of 5 not-yet-created PhoneEntrys

3.	What will the search method return if it does not find a matching PhoneEntry?
	null

5.	Can the linear search algorithm be used on a completely full array? 
	Yes

7.	Does the expression 
	targetName.equals(phoneBook[j].name)
do the same thing as the below expression:
	phoneBook[j].name.equals(targetName)

	It effectively does the same thing, but it doesn't technically do the same thing.
